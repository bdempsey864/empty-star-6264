## User Stories

```
User Story 1 - Team Index

As a user
When I visit the Team Index
Then I see the nickname and hometown of all Teams
And under each team I see the names and ages of all its players
```

```
User Story 2 - Competition Show Page

As a user
When I visit a competition's show page
Then I see the competition's name, location, and sport
And I see the nickname and hometown of all teams in this competition
And I see the average age of all players in the competition
```

```
User Story 3 - Register a Team

As a user
When I visit a competition's show page
Then I see a text field to enter a team nickname
When I fill in this field with the nickname of an existing team
And I click the submit button
Then the team with the nickname that I submitted is associated with this competition
And I am redirected back to the competition's show page
And I see that the team is now listed among the other teams in the competition

(Note: you do not need to handle any sad paths, for example if the nickname entered does not match an existing team)
```

## Extension

```
Extension - Teams sorted by average player age

As a user
When I visit the team index
Then I see that all teams are sorted by their average player age from highest to lowest

(Note: you should only make 1 database query to retrieve the sorted list of teams)
```
